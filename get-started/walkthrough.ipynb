    "# Training a Hugging Face model on the IPU using a local dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "This Pytorch tutorial will show you how to reuse a Hugging Face model and train it on the IPU using a local dataset.\n",
    "Specifically, we will be fine-tuning a Vision Transformer (ViT) model to detect multiple diseases from chest X-rays. As an X-ray image can have multiple diseases we will be training a multi-label classification model.\n",
    "We will use [Graphcore's Optimum interface](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-graphcore) to the [Hugging Face Transformers library](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index) to run an existing model on the IPU.\n",
    "We will be using the [google/vit-base-patch16-224-in21k checkpoint](https://huggingface.co/google/vit-base-patch16-224-in21k) pretrained on ImageNet, fine-tuning it on the NIH Chest X-ray Dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will learn how to:\n",
    "- Repurpose one of the examples from the [Graphcore organisation page on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/Graphcore) to fit your use case.\n",
    "- Preprocess a dataset to fit it to an existing model.\n",
    "- Use the Graphcore model cards found on the [Graphcore organisation page on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/Graphcore) and reuse checkpoints and config files released by Graphcore.\n",
    "- Maximise IPU utilisation for your specific machine by overriding runtime parameters in the `IPUconfig` object made available in the model cards.\n",
    "\n",
    "If this is your first time using IPUs, read the [IPU Programmer's Guide](https://docs.graphcore.ai/projects/ipu-programmers-guide/en/latest/) to learn the basic concepts.\n",
    "To run your own PyTorch model on the IPU see the [Pytorch basics tutorial](https://github.com/graphcore/tutorials/tree/master/tutorials/pytorch/basics), or to see all existing Graphcore models available from Hugging Face go to the [Graphcore organisation page](https://huggingface.co/Graphcore)."

    "In this tutorial we have shown how to train a Hugging Face model on the IPU using a local dataset.\n",
    "To do this, we:\n",
    "- loaded the local dataset using the Hugging Face `datasets` package,\n",
    "- defined transforms to ensure the dataset was compatible with the model,\n",
    "- defined the `IPUTrainer` class to allow the model to run on the IPU,\n",
    "- ran the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset required preprocessing before being compatible with the `datasets` package.\n",
    "We needed to encode the labels as N-hot arrays to make them compatible with the `load_dataset` function.\n",
    "To improve the training of the model, device parameters were loaded and customised in the `IPUConfig` object and hyperparameters were tuned in the `IPUTrainer` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are now ready to use Graphcore and Hugging Face models for your own application.\n",
    "To see all the Hugging Face models available for the IPU, see the [Graphcore organisation page](https://huggingface.co/Graphcore) and for more information about\n",
    "how models are run please consult the [Hugging Face documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs) and the [Graphcore Optimum Library](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-graphcore).\n",
    "For information on how to optimise models for the IPU see the [Memory and Performance Optimisation Guide](https://docs.graphcore.ai/projects/memory-performance-optimisation/).\n",
    "Graphcore also provides reference implementations of model architectures for many applications in the [Graphcore examples repository](https://github.com/graphcore/examples) and in the [Graphcore Model Garden](https://www.graphcore.ai/resources/model-garden)."
