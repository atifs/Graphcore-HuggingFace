    "# Training Hugging Face models on an IPU using Paperspace Gradient\n",
    "\n",
    "These tutorials will show you how to use Hugging Face models and train then on a Graphcore IPU using the Paperspace Gradient environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this environment, you will be able to learn how to use an IPU in a Jupyter-style notebook and use it to train large models including vision transformers (ViT) for images, BERT-Large for question answering, and text classification on the GLUE data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Graphcore Hugging Face models\n",
    "\n",
    "Hugging Face provides convenient access to pre-trained transformer models.\n",
    "\n",
    "The partnership between Hugging Face and Graphcore allows us to fine-tune and run these models on an IPU in Gradient.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "No user setup is required to train IPU models on Gradient.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Vision transformer\n",
    "\n",
    "To get started, open the `get-started` folder and run `walkthrough.ipynb`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial uses the [Vision Transformer model](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-graphcore/tree/main/examples/image-classification) fine-tuned using the NIH Chest X-ray dataset, as an example to show how Hugging Face models can be trained with a local dataset on the IPU.\n",
    "\n",
    "### BERT-Large with Hugging Face Optimum\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, you can go to the `notebooks-tutorial` folder and open up the `introduction_to_optimum_graphcore.ipynb`, which will take you through a BERT-Large model fine-tuning for question answering on the SQuAD dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "This also shows how Hugging Face Optimum can be used to simplify code versus pure PyTorch.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Text classification\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, `text_classification.ipynb` demonstrates text classification on the GLUE benchmarking dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Additional Tutorials\n",
    "\n",
    "***NOTE*** - Additional material has been taken directly from Graphcore's existing repositories outside of Paperspace, and may contain instructions regarding setup steps that are not needed when running on Paperspace.\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A Poplar SDK is required, but it is already set up within Paperspace\n",
    "- Python does not need be run in a virtual environment, because the runtime is already an isolated environment (although `virtualenv` can still be used in principle, via the terminal)\n",
    "- Jupyter is already launched as part of a Gradient runtime when it starts up\n",
    "- SSH is not needed to connect to the runtime\n",
    "\n",
    "Setup steps that may still be needed are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Installing additional requirements for given material, e.g., pip install requirements.txt\n",
    "- Downloading of datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "Additional tutorial material within this runtime can be found at:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python versions of notebook material, ending in `.py`\n",
    "- The `notebook-tutorials/wav2vec2` directory\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have any questions regarding running of IPU material in Gradient, please feel free to reach out to support at support@paperspace.com.\n",
    "\n",
    "More Hugging Face models ported to the IPU can be found on the [Graphcore organisation page on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/Graphcore).\n",
    "\n",
    "Graphcore's original and extensive online GitHub repositories for [tutorials](https://github.com/graphcore/tutorials) and [examples](https://github.com/graphcore/examples) are also available, and can be pointed to when starting up a Gradient runtime under _Advanced Options_."
